This is achieved through the use of an event loop, which constantly monitors the queue of events and dispatches them to the appropriate handlers. When an I/O operation is initiated, it's added to the event loop's queue, and the event loop continues to run other operations while the I/O operation is being performed."

      },
      {
        "type": "",

This process continues until there are no more messages in the queue."
